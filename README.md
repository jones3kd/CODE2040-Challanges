CODE2040-Challanges
===================

Hello!! Thank you for checking out my code. These are 4 challenges I completed for the CODE2040 challenge. http://challenge.code2040.org/

I defintely learned some new things about APIs I had never had any experience with them before but I googled, researched, installed some libraries and figured it out. It was pretty fun passing the stages! I'm also excited to think of some cool ways to use what I've just learned about APIs. APIs are pretty powerful and amazing and now that I know how to use them I'm definitely going to check out some other APIs and see if I can play around with them and make something cool.

-------------------
Python: Fully implemented and complete! Python was a breeze and only took a few hours to learn about APIs and install the libraries and look up how to HTTP Post etc. Ah I do love Python. <3

JavaScript: I started working on the challenge in JavaScript for some extra practice. So far I've created the code for the registration and getting the token. Although I haven't completed all theh stages yet in JavaScript I figured it would be better to show my progress.

Java: I also started working on the challenge in Java. So far I set up the registration and getting the token.

I was curious to learn how the same tasks would be programmed in Java versus Python and JavaScript. I'm definitely starting to see the strengths and weakness of these programming languages! I have an appreciation for how quickly it took to implement the challenge in python. However I also like that Java is static-typed and it's much easier to figure out if I had made mistakes in my code. I'll definitely keep this in mind for future projects!
